This `code` folder includes `R` scripts for reproducible implementations. In particular:
1. `commutatorTest.R` for commutator-based test simulations (Section 3 & 6.2);
2. `LLRTest.R` for log-likelihood ratio test simulations (Section B at supplementary);
3. `highD_Test.R` for two-sample test simulations under high-dimensional setting (with increasing and relatively larger dimensions, Section A.3 at supplementary);
4. `multiTest.R` for multi-sample test simulations (Section 4 & 6.3);
5. `partialTest.R` for partial test simulations (Section 5 & 6.4);
6. `VAR_application.R` for macroeconomic VAR application (Section 7.1);
7. `Discharge_application.R` for Hudson river discharge Markovian model application (Section 7.2).
